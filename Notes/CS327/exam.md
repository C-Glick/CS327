- possible exam topics
	- complete list is defined by the lectures
	- know the relationships between
		- source files
		- object files
			- use -c
		- executable files
		- pre-processor
		- compiler 
		- linker
		- make files
			- format: -> is the tab character
			- dependencies
			- creating targets
			- multiple executable
			- useful targets, "clean", "all"
	- git
		- not syntax as much
		- concepts and functions you can do
	- simple unix stuff
		- IO redirect
	- C
		- main function
		- stuff common with java
			- for loops, if statements, switch etc.
		- ---> ==**pointers**== <---
		- stack memory
			- how it works with function calls
			- how things can go wrong
		- argc and argv
			- argv is a array of char*
			- or a double pointer char**
		- c strings
		- arrays
		- pointer stuff with arrays
		- IO stdio/stdin/stdout, printf, scanf, fprintf, fscanf 
			- FILE stuff
		- ==function pointers==
		- heap memory
			- malloc and free
			- coding with the heap
			- dynamic allocation
			- no calloc or realloc
				- not disallowed though

		- the trio of creation
			- copy constructor
			- destructor
			- operator =
		- references versus pointers
			- can make objects on the stack or heap
			- declaration and ==slicing==
		- defining classes .h vs .cpp 
			- header guards
			- implement in cpp
		- ==const, 5 different uses==
			- immutable classes
			- function doesn't modify member variables
		- reference counting
		- ==inline==
			- what does it mean
		- ==inheritance / polymorphism==
			- types of inheritance, public, protected, private
		- make files for c++
		- nested classes
		- ==friend== def
			- why we use at and how
		- static variables / methods
		- visibility modifies
		- garbage collection 
		- c++ strings
		- casting
			- how and does it interact with inheritance
		- ==memory errors==
			- lifetime errors
