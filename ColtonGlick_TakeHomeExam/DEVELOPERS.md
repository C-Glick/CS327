- Candy class
    - The candy class holds data about the candy objects, including name, candy type, price type, price, quantity, and calories
    - The candy class cannot be initialized directly and must be initialized through a sub-class.
    - Copy constructor
        - The candy class provides a copy constructor to create a deep copy of a candy object
    - Deconstructor
        - The candy class contains a deconstructor, because all member variables are stored on the stack, it does not need to clean up anything and is there for future implementations
    - = operator 
        - The candy class overloads the = operator to assign one candy object to another
    - < operator
        - the candy class overloads the < operator to facilitate sorting a vector of candy objects
    - printDetails()
        - The prints the details of this candy object to standard out
        - prints name, amount in store, and total price on hand
    - getName()
    - getCandyType()
    - getPriceType()
    - getPrice()
    - getAmount()
    - getCalories()
    - setName(string)
    - setCandyType(string)
    - setPriceType(string)
    - setPrice(float)
    - setAmount(int)

- HardCandy and JellyCandy class
    - The HardCandy and JellyCandy class extends the Candy class and adds additional information for color
    - constructor
        - requires: string name, string price type, float price, int amount, float calories, int color (0-9)

    - setColor()
    - These classes also have a copy constructor similar to the Candy class,
    - a deconstructor,
    - and they overload the = operator

    - The ChocolateCandy and the CaramelCandy class extend the Candy class
    - constructor
